## Tuesday, January 18

The master branch now contains an installer that'll fire up the platform in a virtual box. ðŸš€


## Pre-requisites

- [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/vmware/downloads)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- Bash

Under Windows, GitBash from [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)'s bash should do nicely.  
This is where you need to run the installer.sh mentioned in the Installation section below.

## Installation

Get the repo onto your machine using your prefered method, e.g. fork, clone, download, retype...  
Run the installer at the root of the project by using the `./installer.sh` command.  

Add the following binding to your DNS settings:  
> `192.168.56.56        homestead.test`

From the project folder, you can now run `vagrant up` to start the virtual machine.  
You should see it in the Oracle VM GUI, first as idle, and then as running once you've ran the command.  
Use `vagrant halt` to stop the server.

Access WNGX by going to http://homestead.test.  
  
Default **user**: example@example.com  
Default **password**: password 

## Demo

We're working on including a demo course with the platform.  
Meanwhile, you can try a preinstalled, interactive demo in the cloud.  
Details at https://www.webcourses.io/demo.

## About

Online web course platform. Public release still not ready for production systems.
  
  


## Laravel & Angular combo

Angular source files are in `/resources/frontend/webcourses`. They're served via Laravel's AngularController +Blade.

To recompile the Angular source go to `/resources/frontend/webcourses/app/src` and run `npm install`. This'll install the libraries required for Angular and a recompile of the front-end.

With the Angular libraries installed, run `npm run-script build:prod` (check that you're still in `/resources/frontend/webcourses/app/src`).
